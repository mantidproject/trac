Peak

PeakViewFactory - Refactored from PeakOverlayMulti{X}Factory

PeakRepresentation is essentially the Physical{X}Peaks rolled into a public inherited hierarchy with an additional draw method taking a QPainter& 

PeakView is essentially PeakOverlayMulti{X}, inside the paint method, we now call PeakRepresentation::draw(QPainter). Each PeakView instance 
has a unique m_foreground color and m_background color that are applied to all drawn peaks.
