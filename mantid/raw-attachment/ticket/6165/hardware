Hardware Problems

Underpowered and slow build servers: This impacts us by slowing development for all developers.
    Windows 64 Build & Test server, prime build server, current full build takes 50 mins (Build Server)
    win32, current full build takes 90 mins (Low spec build server)
    mac, current full build takes 160 mins  (mac pro 4 core) -> mac test system
    ubuntu, current full build takes 90 mins  (old Win 64 Build Server)

We discussed the use of VM's hosted on a powerful server, but after the SNS team tried this they reverted back to physical hardware after the VM's proved to be too slow for the intensive building jobs.  Also the nature of the build jobs is that theytend to all request resources at the same time, so the benefits of resource sharing do not materialize.


Test servers:
Decent windows test machine 128GB, 4+ core fastish (use win 64 build server)

Dev PCs 
New staff
Mac Developer PC mac book pro

Other issues:
One failing monitor needs to be replaced -> wall display

Commercial profiling tools??
Profilers to try before going commercial
