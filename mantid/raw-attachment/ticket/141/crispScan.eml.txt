Hi Russell,

Please find attached. It's all the files created with a crisp alignment scan (i.e. logs etc) which I'm sure you don’t need but I thought I'd send anyway.

Anyway, CSP79173.raw has 12 periods in it, which are set up as follows....

 

 

S0    - empty

S1    - Monitor 1, Period 1

S2    - Monitor 2, Period 1

S3    - Detector , Period 1

S4    - Empty

S5    - Empty

S6    - Monitor 1, Period 2

S7    - Monitor 2, Period 2

S8    - Detector, Period 2

...Etc...

 

 

Not sure there's a huge amount of counts here. We don't normally save our alignment scans like this (we normally just save the final, processed x/y/e data) so we don’t have many of them.

 

More generally, I've just spoken to Rob Dalgliesh and John Webster, and between our two reflectometers (surf and crisp), we have lots of different types of data that you should have, once you factor in scans and different detectors etc.

As an example, below is what John wrote off the top of his head as to what we have on surf in terms of detectors, and its possible to scan with each of the three detector configurations. What I'll do is to collate all the different types we have between the two instruments, and try to find at least one file of each type.

Hows that!

Cheers,

Arwel

Single detector

S(0)      rubbish collection

S(1)      monitor 1

S(2)      monitor 2

S(3)      detector

If using periods (e.g. a scan) then total spectra should be nper x 4 i.e. for the next period

S(4)      rubbish collection, 2nd period

S(5)      monitor 1, 2nd period

S(6)      monitor 2, 2nd period

S(7)      detector, 2nd period

 

Multi detector with horizontal elements ganged together

S(0)      rubbish collection

S(1)      1st  row of multidetector

.

.

S(46)    last row of multidetector

S(47)    monitor 1

S(48)    monitor 2

S(49)    single detector

If using periods (e.g. a scan) then total spectra should be nper x 50 i.e. for the next period

S(50)    rubbish collection for 2nd period etc…

 

Multi detector with all elements

S(0)      rubbish collection

S(1)      top left pixel

S(2)      next pixel down

.

.

S(46)    bottom most pixel left hand side

 

S(47)    top pixel 2nd column in

.

.

S(92)

And so on to S(1840)

S(1841)             monitor 1

S(1842)             monitor 2

S(1843)             single detector

 

All of the above usually with 1000 time bins

Haven’t used multi detector with all pixels and periods
